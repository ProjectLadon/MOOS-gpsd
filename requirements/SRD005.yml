    pGPSd **shall** publish the following data derived from the given members of gps_fix_t:

    * GPSD_mode = gps_fix_t.mode -- this the GPS fix mode
    * GPSD_latitude = gps_fix_t.latitude -- this is the latitude, in WGS84 decimal degrees
    * GPSD_longitude = gps_fix_t.longitude -- this is the longitude, in WGS84 decimal degrees
    * GPSD_elevation = gps_fix_t.altitude -- this is the altitude, in meters above the WGS84 datum
    * GPSD_speed = gps_fix_t.speed -- this is the forward speed in meters per second
    * GPSD_track = gps_fix_t.track -- this is the true course in degrees clockwise from north
